It is important to separate <strong>front-end</strong> and <strong>back-end</strong> as much as you can. <br> That way, it will be much more manageable.

In programming in general, it seems to be important to keep away a set of certain things from other sets,
  possibly for maintainability, work-efficiency, readibility, etc.
